## Description

You will be introduced to NCBI's Comparative Sequence Viewer [CGV](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cgv/), a web application that visualizes whole genome eukaryotic assembly-assembly alignments provided by NCBI. You will learn how to best take advantage of the CGV display, including tips on using zoom and filtering options to uncover biologically significant differences between two related genomes. We are in active development, so please contact us at NCBI with your requests for this tool.

## Prerequisites

1. Undergraduate level knowledge of molecular biology and genetics
