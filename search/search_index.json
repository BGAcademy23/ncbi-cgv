You will learn how to best take advantage of the CGV display, including tips on using zoom and filtering options to uncover biologically significant differences between two related genomes. We are in active development, so please contact us at NCBI with your requests for this tool.</p>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ol> <li>Undergraduate level knowledge of molecular biology and genetics</li> </ol> <p>Please make sure you MEET THE PREREQUISITES and READ THE DESCRIPTION above</p> <p>You will get the most out of this session if you meet the prerequisites above.</p> <p>Please also read the description carefully to see if this session is relevant to you.</p> <p>If you don't meet the prerequisites or change your mind based on the description or are no longer available at the session time, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk to cancel your slot so that someone else on the waitlist might attend.</p>"}]}
